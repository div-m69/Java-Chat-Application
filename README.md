# Java-Chat-Application
This chat application uses Sockets, Threads, and Web Services in JAVA.

This project can be mainly divided into two modules: 
1. Server 
2. Client

This project is mainly depended on client/server model. The client requests the server and server 
responses by granting the clients request.

Web-based chatting software is unique in its features and more importantly easily 
customizable.

Typically, programs running on client machines make 
requests to programs on a server Machine. These involve networking services provided by 
the transport layer. The most widely used transport protocols on the Internet are TCP 
(Transmission control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
